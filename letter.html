  <h1>To Kupal na Kenneth</h1>

  <p>Happy Birthday!</p>

  <p>Time flies so fast, and yet you’re still here with me. There were moments when we even questioned if we could really make it—but because of you, we’ve come this far.
</p>

  <p>I just want to thank you for all your sacrifices, not just for me, but for everything you've done in your life. I know you face your own silent battles every day, and I want you to know that I’m here if you ever need me.</p>

  <p>I’m also sorry if I’ve ever hurt your feelings, if I couldn’t help you with some things, or if I made you cry at night. Please know that I’m trying my best.</p>

  <p>And I want you to know that I’m so proud of you. I’m still your number one fan—even when we compete. I hope you achieve your dreams, even without me. Because more than anything, I just want to see you win in life.</p>


  <p> Just hold on a little longer, okay? I’ll be with you soon once we graduate. And we’ll celebrate your birthday together. Happy 21st! but still always my baby. I love you<3</p>
